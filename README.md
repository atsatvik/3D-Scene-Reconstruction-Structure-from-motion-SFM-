# 3D Structure from Motion (SfM) Algorithm

## Overview
Structure from Motion (SfM) is a computer vision technique that reconstructs a 3D scene from a set of 2D images. This algorithm aims to recover the 3D structure of a scene and the camera poses from a series of images.

## Steps

1. **Feature Matching and Outlier Rejection using RANSAC:**
   - Identify key features in multiple images.
   - Use the Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) algorithm to robustly match these features across images.
   - Eliminate outliers to improve the accuracy of subsequent steps.

2. **Estimating Fundamental Matrix:**
   - Calculate the Fundamental Matrix, a fundamental geometric relationship between image pairs.
   - It describes the epipolar geometry between two views.

3. **Estimating Essential Matrix from Fundamental Matrix:**
   - Derive the Essential Matrix from the Fundamental Matrix by incorporating camera intrinsic parameters.
   - The Essential Matrix encapsulates information about the relative pose of the cameras.

4. **Estimate Camera Pose from Essential Matrix:**
   - Extract camera poses (rotation and translation) from the Essential Matrix.
   - Recover the motion of the camera in relation to the scene.

5. **Check for Cheirality Condition using Triangulation:**
   - Ensure that the reconstructed points lie in front of both cameras by applying the cheirality condition.
   - Discard points violating this condition as they may be behind one of the cameras.

6. **Perspective-n-Point:**
   - Utilize the Perspective-n-Point (PnP) algorithm to estimate the 3D position of the matched points in the world coordinates.
   - This step refines the initial camera poses obtained from the Essential Matrix.

7. **Bundle Adjustment (using GTSAM):**
   - Optimize the entire reconstruction by jointly refining camera poses and 3D points.
   - Leverage the Generalized Trajectory Optimization (GTSAM) library for efficient bundle adjustment.

## Implementation
   - The implementation of these steps in your project may involve using libraries like OpenCV for fundamental and essential matrix calculations, GTSAM for bundle adjustment, and other relevant computer vision libraries.

## Usage
   - Provide clear instructions on how to use your SfM algorithm in your project, specifying input requirements and expected output.

By following these steps, your SfM algorithm will effectively reconstruct 3D scenes from a series of 2D images, providing valuable insights into the structure and motion of the observed environment.
